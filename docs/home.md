## Welcome to the Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit!

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook and many other Static Site Generators (SSG), it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown content files and displays them as a website.
